Abstract
This document specifies level 1 of the Cascading Style Sheet mechanism (CSS1). CSS1 is a simple style sheet
mechanism that allows authors and readers to attach style (e.g. fonts, colors and spacing) to HTML documents.
The CSS1 language is human readable and writable, and expresses style in common desktop publishing terminology.

One of the fundamental features of CSS is that style sheets cascade; authors can attach a preferred style sheet,
 while the reader may have a personal style sheet to adjust for human or technological handicaps. The rules for resolving conflicts between different style sheets are defined in this specification. 

This Recommendation results from W3C activities in the area of Style Sheets. For background information on style
sheets, see [1].
